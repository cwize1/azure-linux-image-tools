## Security Vulnerabilities

<!-- BEGIN MICROSOFT SECURITY.MD V0.0.3 BLOCK -->

### Security

Microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, which include [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), [DotNet](https://github.com/dotnet), [AspNet](https://github.com/aspnet), [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin), and [our GitHub organizations](https://opensource.microsoft.com/).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that meets Microsoft's [Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc751383(v=technet.10)) of a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com).  If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pgp-key-msrc).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award. Please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://microsoft.com/msrc/bounty) page for more details about our active programs.

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

### Policy

Microsoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/cvd).

<!-- END MICROSOFT SECURITY.MD BLOCK -->

## Development

We welcome contributions. When contributing, please adhere to `golang` formatting as described by the [fmt](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt) package. To format using this package, you can run `make go-tidy-all`.

### Documentation

We welcome documentation improvements. See [toolkit/docs](toolkit/docs) for the latest documentation.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Please direct pull requests to  `main` branch.

### Branch structure

An overview of how the branches are structured can be seen below

| Branch / Tag | For PRs | Published | Notes                          |
| :----------- | :------ | :-------- | :----------------------------- |
| main         | Yes     | No        | **Primary development branch** |

### PR Titles

PR titles should start with an action

```bash
- Add <feature>
- Bump Release version for <release>
- Change whatever you changed.
- Fix <thing you fixed> <reason you fixed it>
```

Please avoid ambiguous titles.

### PR Checklist

When creating your PR, please ensure the following:

* Ensure that the formatting meets golang's standards and that the tests still pass.

   ```bash
   cd toolkit
   # fix formatting
   sudo make go-tidy-all
   # check tests
   sudo make go-test-coverage
   ```

* Documentation has been updated to match any changes to the build system.
